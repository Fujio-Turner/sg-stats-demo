# sg-stats-demo

Pulls stats from SG Admin port localhost:4985/_expvar and puts them into a basic graph.

Here is a link about whats in the _expvar https://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/mobile/2.0/references/sync-gateway/admin-rest-api/index.html#/server/get__expvar

Works with SG 2.x and lower.
